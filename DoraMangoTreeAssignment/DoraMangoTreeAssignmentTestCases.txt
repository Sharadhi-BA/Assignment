Dora is interested so much in gardening and she plants more trees in her garden. She plants trees in a rectangular fashion with the order of rows and columns and numbered the trees in row-wise order. She planted the mango tree only in a 1st row, 1st column and last column. So given the tree number, your task is to find whether the given tree is a mango tree or not? Write a program to check whether the given number is a mango tree or not.
  
Assumption: 
	Input is taken for rows and columns.
	
Exceptions:
	Tree number greater than the planted trees.
	Tree number is 0 or in negative.
	Rows and Columns is negative or 0.
Sample Test cases:

T1:Row=3,Column=5
	1   2   3   4   5 
	6   7   8   9   10
	11 12 13 14 15
TreeNumber=12
Output:Not a mango tree.

T2:Row=3,Column=5
	1   2   3   4   5 
	6   7   8   9   10
	11 12 13 14 15
TreeNumber=1
Output: mango tree.	

T3:Row=3,Column=5
	1   2   3   4   5 
	6   7   8   9   10
	11 12 13 14 15
TreeNumber=4
Output: mango tree.	

T4:Row=3,Column=5
	1   2   3   4   5 
	6   7   8   9   10
	11 12 13 14 15
TreeNumber=11
Output: mango tree.

T5:Row=3,Column=5
	1   2   3   4   5 
	6   7   8   9   10
	11 12 13 14 15
